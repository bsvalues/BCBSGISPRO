# Test-Driven Development Plan for BentonGeoPro

This document outlines the test-driven development (TDD) approach for ongoing development of the BentonGeoPro application.

## TDD Process

For each new feature or bug fix, follow this workflow:

1. **Write the Test**: Create tests that define the expected behavior
2. **Run the Test**: Verify that the test fails as expected
3. **Implement the Feature**: Write the code to make the test pass
4. **Run the Test Again**: Verify that the test passes
5. **Refactor**: Clean up code while ensuring tests still pass

## Feature Development Roadmap

- **Expected behavior**: Annotations can contain formatted text and icons

### 3. Document Classification System

#### 3.1. Classification Confidence Tuning
- **Tests**: Add tests for adjustable confidence thresholds
- **Implementation**: Add UI for setting confidence thresholds for auto-classification
- **Expected behavior**: Documents above threshold are auto-classified, others flagged for review

- **Tests**: Add tests for processing multiple documents
- **Implementation**: Create batch processing interface
- **Expected behavior**: Multiple documents can be uploaded and classified in one operation

#### 3.3. Classification Feedback Loop
- **Tests**: Add tests for training the classification system with feedback
- **Implementation**: Add UI for providing feedback on classifications
- **Expected behavior**: System improves classification accuracy based on feedback

### 4. Workflow Management

#### 4.1. Workflow Templates
- **Tests**: Add tests for creating and using workflow templates
- **Implementation**: Create template system for workflows
- **Expected behavior**: Users can create new workflows from templates

#### 4.2. Workflow Notifications
- **Tests**: Add tests for notification generation and delivery
- **Implementation**: Add notification system for workflow events
- **Expected behavior**: Users receive notifications for important workflow events

#### 4.3. Workflow Analytics
- **Tests**: Add tests for generating workflow analytics
- **Implementation**: Create analytics dashboard for workflows
- **Expected behavior**: Users can view metrics on workflow efficiency and progress

### 5. Measurement System Improvements

#### 5.1. Measurement Persistence
- **Tests**: Add tests for saving and loading measurements
- **Implementation**: Add functionality to save measurements to database
- **Expected behavior**: Measurements persist between sessions

#### 5.2. Measurement Export
- **Tests**: Add tests for exporting measurements in various formats
- **Implementation**: Add export functionality for measurements
- **Expected behavior**: Measurements can be exported in formats like GeoJSON, CSV, etc.

#### 5.3. Measurement Comparisons
- **Tests**: Add tests for comparing multiple measurements
- **Implementation**: Add UI for side-by-side measurement comparison
- **Expected behavior**: Users can compare multiple measurements

## Testing Key Integrations

### 1. Document-Parcel Link System

#### 1.1. Link Creation Tests
- Test that documents can be linked to parcels
- Test validation of document-parcel links

#### 1.2. Link Search Tests
- Test searching for parcels with linked documents
- Test searching for documents by linked parcel

### 2. Map-Document Integration

#### 2.1. Document Geotagging Tests
- Test adding geographic coordinates to documents
- Test displaying geotagged documents on map

#### 2.2. Spatial Document Search Tests
- Test searching for documents by map area
- Test displaying document search results on map

### 3. Workflow-Map Integration

#### 3.1. Spatial Workflow Tests
- Test creating workflows associated with map areas
- Test filtering workflows by geography

#### 3.2. Map-Based Workflow Status Tests
- Test displaying workflow status on map
- Test updating workflows from map interface

## Test Coverage Strategy

For each component, aim for test coverage in these categories:

1. **Functionality**: Tests that verify the component functions correctly
2. **Edge Cases**: Tests for boundary conditions and unusual inputs
3. **Error Handling**: Tests that verify proper error handling
4. **Integration**: Tests that verify the component works with other components
5. **Performance**: Tests that verify performance meets requirements

## Testing Utilities

Create these testing utilities to support the TDD process:

1. **Test Data Generators**: Functions to generate test data for different scenarios
2. **Mock Services**: Mock implementations of external services
3. **Test Hooks**: Custom React testing hooks for common testing patterns
4. **Test Fixtures**: Reusable test data setups
5. **Test Helpers**: Helper functions for common testing tasks

## Developer Testing Guidelines

When developing with TDD, follow these guidelines:

1. **Test First**: Always write the test before implementing the feature
2. **Small Increments**: Make small, testable changes rather than large refactors
3. **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% test coverage for new code
4. **End-to-End Testing**: For critical paths, add end-to-end tests
5. **Performance Testing**: For performance-critical features, add performance tests

## Continuous Integration Testing

Configure CI pipeline to:

1. Run unit tests on every commit
2. Run integration tests on every PR
3. Run end-to-end tests on every release candidate
4. Run performance tests weekly
5. Generate and publish test coverage reports

## Test Maintenance

Keep tests healthy by:

1. **Updating Tests**: Update tests when requirements change
2. **Removing Obsolete Tests**: Remove tests for deprecated features
3. **Refactoring Tests**: Refactor tests to reduce duplication
4. **Test Performance**: Optimize slow tests
5. **Test Reliability**: Fix flaky tests
