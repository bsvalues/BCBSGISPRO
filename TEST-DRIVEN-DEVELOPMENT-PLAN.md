# Test-Driven Development Plan for Benton County Assessor's Office GIS Application

## Overview
This document outlines our test-driven development approach for the Benton County Assessor's Office GIS and Workflow Modernization project. By establishing a robust testing framework before implementing new features, we ensure code stability, functional reliability, and seamless integration between components.

## Core Testing Principles
1. **Test First**: Write tests before implementing features
2. **Incremental Progress**: Build and test one feature at a time
3. **Regression Prevention**: Prevent new changes from breaking existing functionality
4. **Complete Coverage**: Test all critical components, including edge cases
5. **Realistic Data**: Use representative test data that mirrors production

## Testing Layers

### 1. Schema/Model Tests
- **Purpose**: Verify data structure integrity and type definitions
- **Files**: `__tests__/shared/schema.test.ts`
- **What To Test**: 
  - Schema structure completeness
  - Type correctness (e.g., User, Workflow, Document types)
  - Enum values and relationships

### 2. Storage Layer Tests
- **Purpose**: Verify data persistence and retrieval operations
- **Files**: `__tests__/server/storage.test.ts`
- **What To Test**:
  - CRUD operations for all entities
  - Error handling for missing or invalid data
  - Query filtering and search operations
  - Transaction integrity

### 3. API/Routes Tests
- **Purpose**: Verify REST endpoints and authentication
- **Files**: `__tests__/server/routes.test.ts`
- **What To Test**:
  - Endpoint availability and HTTP status codes
  - Authentication requirements
  - Response data structure
  - Error handling and edge cases

### 4. Client Component Tests
- **Purpose**: Verify React components and UI behavior
- **Files**: `__tests__/client/*.test.tsx`
- **What To Test**:
  - Component rendering
  - User interactions (clicks, form submissions)
  - State management
  - Responsive behavior

### 5. Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Verify end-to-end workflows across components
- **What To Test**:
  - Complete workflow processes (create workflow → add document → link parcel → generate report)
  - Data flow between components
  - Application state consistency

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Stability (Current Phase)
1. ✅ Write schema tests to validate data models
2. ✅ Create storage layer tests for CRUD operations
3. ✅ Implement API tests for authentication and core endpoints
4. ⏳ Fix database migration issues (worklow_events table)
5. ⏳ Verify application startup and authentication flow

### Phase 2: Workflow Management
1. Write tests for workflow creation endpoints
2. Test workflow state persistence and retrieval
3. Test workflow events tracking
4. Implement and test checklist item functionality
5. Verify workflow dashboard views and filters

### Phase 3: Document Management
1. Test document upload and storage
2. Test document classification mechanisms
3. Implement document-parcel linking tests
4. Test document version control
5. Verify batch document operations

### Phase 4: Map and Parcel Management
1. Test map layer control functionality
2. Implement parcel generation tests
3. Test parcel search and filtering
4. Verify map visualization components
5. Test geospatial analysis features

### Phase 5: Reporting System
1. Test report template management
2. Implement report generation tests
3. Test scheduled reports functionality
4. Verify report export formats
5. Test SM00 report generation specifics

## Test Data Approach
For testing, we will create a structured set of test data that includes:
1. Sample workflows of different types (long_plat, bla, merge_split)
2. Representative documents for each document type
3. Parcel data with proper geometries and attributes
4. User accounts with varied permission levels
5. Map layers with different visualization settings

## Best Practices
1. Keep tests independent and idempotent
2. Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
3. Separate test data setup from test assertions
4. Mock external dependencies consistently
5. Clean up test data after tests complete

## Tools and Framework
- Jest for testing framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Supertest for API endpoint testing
